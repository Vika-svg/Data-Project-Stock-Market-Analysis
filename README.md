# Data-Project-Stock-Market-Analysis

Welcome to your second data project! In this portfolio project we will be looking at data from the stock market, particularly some technology stocks. We will learn how to use pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a Monte Carlo method!

We'll be answering the following questions along the way:

- What was the change in price of the stock over time?

- What was the daily return of the stock on average?

- What was the moving average of the various stocks?

- What was the correlation between different stocks' closing prices?

- What was the correlation between different stocks' daily returns?

- How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?

- How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior?
